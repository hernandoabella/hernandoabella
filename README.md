### 👨‍💻 Senior Full Stack Engineer

Since I was little I started using computers to entertain myself by playing video games on web browsers. This over time allowed me to learn new skills little by little and I reached the level I wanted so much after years of trying with tests and experiments.

The first time I used a computer I was just a curious child wanting to learn wonderful things in the world of technology, now that I can make it happen I compete every day with myself to be better than my previous version.
